    <title>sFlightX - Preparing the Block Five</title>
</head>
<body>
    <p>The <b>Maya Block 5</b> rocket is set to lift off NET June 07, 11:10 UTC at Bataan Space Center.
        Window lasts upto 110 minutes with backup on the 9th and 10th.</p>
    <p>The Maya family of rockets evolve faster as our teams gather more data per flights.
        Through extensive testing of the spacecraft's attitude on ascent until landing, we have upgraded for a more safer, more powerful and human-rated booster, the Block 5.</p>
    <p>Lessons learned from the previous 7 flights were obtained, including the experimental landing tests downrange either the sea or by land, and a single RTLS attempt on flight 6.
        This mission will feature an enhanced Guidance and Navigation Systems (GNS) that guides Maya on a nominal descent path to landing.
        This includes the precision orbit and landing on both the vehicles.</p>
    <p>Flight 8, which we will call <i>Experimental Landing Mission - 1 (EXT-1)</i>. This mission's flight objectives is to nominally launch Maya 5 into space, and put our customer payload <b>@OmegaLink</b> to orbit.</p>
    <p>Before we proceed, we updated several Maya hardwares, and the most noticeable is its size. Block 5 introduces 75% of Maya Block 4's height, for a more shorter fuel capacity.</p>
    <p>Since we shortened the size of the fuel tanks, we made our engine, <b>Agila Engine</b> more powerful producing 2,000 kN of thrust each.
        With a more cleaner CH2 LOX engine, our rocket is environmental friendly.</p>

    <p>Future missions will be launching once operational. If the payload deploys, we will focus on Maya Heavy for <b>@ZastenX</b>'s ObSat-1 Mission to the moon. This 8th flight will teach us on basic controls of the new Maya 5, and everything after success is icing on the cake!</p>
